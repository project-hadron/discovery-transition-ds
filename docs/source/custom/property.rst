AbstractPropertyManager
=======================

The ``AbstractPropertiesManager`` facilitates the management of all the contract properties  including that of the
connector handlers, parameterised intent and Augmented Knowledge

The Class initialisation is abstracted and is the only abstracted method. A concrete implementation of the
overloaded ``__init__`` manages the ``root_key`` and ``knowledge_key`` for this construct. The ``root_key`` adds a key
property reference to the root of the properties and can be referenced directly with ``<name>_key``. Likewise
the ``knowledge_key`` adds a catalog key to the restricted catalog keys.

More complex ``root_key`` constructs, where a grouping of keys might be desirable, passing a dictionary of name
value pairs as part of the list allows a root base to group related next level keys. For example

.. code-block:: python

    root_key = [{base: [primary, secondary}]

would add ``base.primary_key`` and ``base.secondary_key`` to the list of keys.

Here is a default example of an initialisation method:

.. code-block:: python

        def __init__(self, task_name: str):
            # set additional keys
            root_keys = []
            knowledge_keys = []
            super().__init__(task_name=task_name, root_keys=root_keys, knowledge_keys=knowledge_keys)


The property manager is not responsible for persisting the properties but provides the methods to load and persist
its in memory structure. To initialise the load and persist a ConnectorContract must be set up.

The following is a code snippet of setting a ConnectorContract and loading its content

.. code-block:: python

            self.set_property_connector(connector_contract=connector_contract)
            if self.get_connector_handler(self.CONNECTOR_PM_CONTRACT).exists():
                self.load_properties(replace=replace)

When using the property manager it will not automatically persist its properties and must be explicitely managed in
the component class. This removes the persist decision making away from the property manager. To persist the
properties use the method call ``persist_properties()``
