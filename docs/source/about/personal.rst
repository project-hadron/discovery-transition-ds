Darryl Oatridge
---------------

I am a senior software engineer, architect and data scientist building solutions and exploring theories to bridge
the gap between machine learning and its productionisation.

Born out of the frustration of time constraints and the inability to show business value within a business
expectation, I envisaged a solution that aimed to provide a set of capabilities to quickly build production
ready data science disciplines within a component based solution.

Through this I have developed Project Hadron, an adaptable and repeatable set of data science capabilities,
including synthesising date, to create, dimentionalise and transform features of interest for model train.
Once trained and optimised Project Hadron encapsulates the trained solution to predict and provide insight
that fits within a production environment.
